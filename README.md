Thanks to the wrapper [simpleguitk](https://github.com/dholm/simpleguitk/) over simplegui by 
[http://www.codeskulptor.org/](CodeSkulptor) by Rice University to help bring the joy of building these simple games 
from the browser to a environment of your choice.

To tinker you just need to setup your conda environment and install using pip:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
